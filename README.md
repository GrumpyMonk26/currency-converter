# Currency Converter App

### Vanilla Javascript Project

#### Project description

##### In this project, we will develop a currency converter with a wide range of currency options. Upon selecting a currency, the application will promptly fetch the current exchange rate from an API. Users can enter an amount in one currency and instantly view the equivalent amount in the other currency, providing real-time conversion. To accomplish this, we will utilize JavaScript to retrieve data from the currency API. This project presents an excellent opportunity to gain knowledge about currency conversion, making API requests, and leveraging JavaScript to build dynamic web applications.
